Two lines may intersect at one zero or infinite points.

Difficulty when we represent w/ a pair of points-we cannot tell if two lines are same.

y=mx+c representation doesnt work when we have a line parallel w/ y axis.

When we represent a line w/ ax+by+c=0 ,the difficulty is that k(ax+by+c) will also be a representation for that line.

We can overcome this difficulty by making b=1 when it is non zero ,otherwise setting a=1.

Area  of polygon= 1/2 * Summation (From i=0 to n-1) Xi * Yi+1 - Xi+1 + Yi

A regular polygon that can be formed with integer coordinates is a square.

What is the number of integer coordinates(end points included) on a line segment with integer end coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)?
If you include the initial point too ans is GCD(abs(y2-y1),abs(x2-x1)) +1 .

Minimum distance of point(C)from a line segment(A,B) :Note if the perpendicular drooped from the point to the line of the line segment is not b/w the two points, then the 
point closest to C is either A or B.
