<script src="myScript.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

2)JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
JavaScript Can Change HTML Attributes
JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
JavaScript Can Validate Data
JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

3)Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
//write at the end of the document
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.     Ex:document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
// first element whose id is "demo". //If it already has some text,it will be replaced.
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

4)JavaScript Events

<some-HTML-element some-event='some JavaScript'>
Like
<button onclick='getElementById("demo").innerHTML=Date()'>The time is?</button>
<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

5)String methods

Number Methods

Mathematical functions

Array methods
http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp

6)For numbers(integers,floats etc) there is only one datatype in JS which is number.

7)Difference b/w === and ==

===	equal value and equal type	
Say x=5  then x === 5 is true and x === "5" will be false.

8)Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.

9)Converting Variables to Numbers
There are 3 JavaScript methods that can be used to convert variables to numbers:

The Number() method
The parseInt() method
The parseFloat() method

10)***** We can use html elements like <br> <ul> in js code to display data on web page.

11)***Accessing a String as an Array is Unsafe.If you want to read a string as an array, convert it to an array first.

12)Difference b/w null and undefined
var person;                  // Value is undefined, type is undefined
var person = null;           // Value is null, but type is still an object
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

13)JS Errors.

14)In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
However JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.

15) "use strict";  Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".

16)You must use a "backslash" if you must break a statement in a string:

Example 3
var x = "Hello \
World!";


17)Debugging in JS
If your browser supports debugging, you can use console.log() to display JavaScript values in the debugger window:

Chrome
Open the browser.
From the menu, select tools.
From tools, choose developer tools.
Finally, select Console.

18)Beware of Automatic Type Conversions
Beware that numbers can accidentally be converted to strings or NaN (Not a Number).

Example
var x = "Hello";     // typeof x is a string
x = 5;               // changes typeof x to a number

19)Use Parameter Defaults
If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.

20)Reduce DOM Access
Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.

If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:

Example
obj = document.getElementById("demo");
obj.innerHTML = "Hello";

20)Performance:

21)Error Handling:http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp
The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

The catch statement lets you handle the error.

The throw statement lets you create custom errors.

The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

22)In JavaScript there are 5 different data types that can contain values:

string
number
boolean
object
function
There are 3 types of objects:// ****typeof(array) return Object

Object
Date
Array

And 2 data types that cannot contain values:

null
undefined

23)Type conversion

String(val) can be used to convert date,number,boolean to string.

Convert date to number://milliseconds
d = new Date();
Number(d)
