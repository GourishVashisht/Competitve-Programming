There are 4 ways of initiating a date:

new Date()
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(dateString)
new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)

Using new Date(), creates a new date object with the current date and time.

When you display a date object in HTML, it is automatically converted to a string, with the toString() method.
In the last case we can omit any of the last 4 parameters.

JavaScript Date Input
There are generally 4 types of JavaScript date formats:

ISO Dates
Long Dates
Short Dates
Full Format

JavaScript ISO Dates

var d = new Date("2015-03-25");
var d = new Date("2015-03");
var d = new Date("2015");
var d = new Date("2015-03-25T12:00:00");

The T in the date string, between the date and time, indicates UTC time.
Note UTC (Universal Time Coordinated)  is the same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time

JavaScript Long Dates
