bottom up-only constant amt of space needed because we only need the last two fib. no's.We can delete prev. values.

running time:treating recursive calls as O(1)

Each input will be computed at most once Time complexity is O(n × k), where k is the time complexity of computing an
 input if we assume that the recursive calls are returned directly from memory(O(1))

Since we’re only doing constant amount of work tocompute the answer to an input, k = O(1)

Total time complexity is O(n).
